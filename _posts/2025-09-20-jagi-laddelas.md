Aleksi Ahlakorpi is a bilingual comedian who grew up between two cultures, giving him a unique inside–outside perspective on both Finnish and Sámi life. His stand-up blends sharp one-liners with longer storytelling, exploring themes such as cross-cultural differences, gender roles, and what it means to live as a non-Sámi, Sámi-speaking man in Sápmi. As he puts it: “You guys wanted a Netflix special — you got Aleksi in a lávvu.” The film will be shown in Sápmi Film.
